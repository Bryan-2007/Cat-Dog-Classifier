🐾 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier
Welcome, explorers of AI! 🚀

This project is my take on solving the classic machine learning challenge: classifying images as either cats 🐱 or dogs 🐶.
Built with TensorFlow and Keras, this model showcases the power of deep learning, smart data handling, and a little bit of trial-and-error magic. ✨

Feel free to dive into the code, tinker with the model, and make it your own! Whether you're here to learn, contribute, or just see what a dedicated weekend (and too much coffee ☕) can build — you're more than welcome.

"The best way to predict the future is to create it." — Let's create together.
